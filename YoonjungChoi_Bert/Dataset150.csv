The Universe,"The Universe is everything we can touch, feel, sense, measure or detect. It includes living things, planets, stars, galaxies, dust clouds, light, and even time. Before the birth of the Universe, time, space and matter did not exist. The Universe contains billions of galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars. The space between the stars and galaxies is largely empty. However, even places far from stars and planets contain scattered particles of dust or a few hydrogen atoms per cubic centimeter. Space is also filled with radiation (e.g. light and heat), magnetic fields and high energy particles (e.g. cosmic rays). The Universe is incredibly huge. It would take a modern jet fighter more than a million years to reach the nearest star to the Sun. Travelling at the speed of light (300,000 km per second), it would take 100,000 years to cross our Milky Way galaxy alone. No one knows the exact size of the Universe, because we cannot see the edge – if there is one. All we do know is that the visible Universe is at least 93 billion light years across. (A light year is the distance light travels in one year – about 9 trillion km.) The Universe has not always been the same size. Scientists believe it began in a Big Bang, which took place nearly 14 billion years ago. Since then, the Universe has been expanding outward at very high speed. So the area of space we now see is billions of times bigger than it was when the Universe was very young. The galaxies are also moving further apart as the space between them expands.",What is in the Universe?,"living things, planets, stars, galaxies, dust clouds, light, and even time"

The Big Bang,"Most astronomers believe the Universe began in the Big Bang about 14 billion years ago. At that time, the entire Universe was inside a bubble that was thousands of times smaller than a pinhead. It was hotter and denser than anything we can imagine. Then it suddenly exploded. The Universe that we know was born. Time, space and matter all began with the Big Bang. In a fraction of a second, the Universe grew from smaller than a single atom to bigger than a galaxy. And it kept on growing at a fantastic rate. It is still expanding today. As the Universe expanded and cooled, energy changed into particles of matter and antimatter. These two opposite types of particles largely destroyed each other. But some things survived. More stable particles called protons and neutrons started to form when the Universe was one second old. Over the next three minutes, the temperature dropped below 1 billion degrees Celsius. It was now cool enough for the protons and neutrons to come together, forming hydrogen and helium nuclei. After 300 000 years, the Universe had cooled to about 3000 degrees. Atomic nuclei could finally capture electrons to form atoms. The Universe is filled with clouds of hydrogen and helium gas.",When Big Bang start?,about 14 billion years ago

Our nearest star,"The Sun is our nearest star. The Sun provides us with light and heat. It also gives out dangerous ultraviolet light which causes sunburn and may cause cancer. Without the Sun there would be no daylight, and our planet would simply be a dark, frozen world, with no oceans of liquid water and no life. This huge ball of superhot gas is 1.4 million kilometers across, equal to 109 Earths set side by side. With a mass of 2 million-trillion-trillion-trillion kilograms, it weighs as much as 330 000 Earths. About 1 300000 Earths would fit inside the Sun! From Earth, the Sun looks like it moves across the sky in the daytime and appears to disappear at night. This is because the Earth is spinning towards the east. The Earth spins about its axis, an imaginary line that runs through the middle of the Earth between the North and South poles. This means that to us here on the spinning Earth, the Sun appears to rise in the east in the morning, and climb higher and higher in the sky towards midday. In the afternoon the Sun then seems to move lower and lower in the sky before setting in the west. Although it seems small when seen at sunrise or sunset, this is only because the Sun lies about 150 million km away from us. At this distance, it takes about 8 minutes for sunlight to reach us – even when it is traveling at about 300 000 km/s. This means that we see the Sun set eight minutes after the event has actually taken place!",Which is our nearest star?,The Sun is our nearest star.

Although it seems small when seen at sunrise or sunset, this is only because the Sun lies about 150 million km away from us. At this distance, it takes about 8 minutes for sunlight to reach us – even when it is travelling at about 300 000 km/s. This means that we see the Sun set eight minutes after the event has actually taken place!",Why the Sun rises in East and sets in West?,the Earth is spinning towards the east
Our nearest star,"The Sun is our nearest star. The Sun provides us with light and heat. It also gives out dangerous ultraviolet light which causes sunburn and may cause cancer. Without the Sun there would be no daylight, and our planet would simply be a dark, frozen world, with no oceans of liquid water and no life. This huge ball of superhot gas is 1.4 million kilometres across, equal to 109 Earths set side by side. With a mass of 2 million-trillion-trillion-trillion kilograms, it weighs as much as 330 000 Earths. About 1 300000 Earths would fit inside the Sun! From Earth, the Sun looks like it moves across the sky in the daytime and appears to disappear at night. This is because the Earth is spinning towards the east.

The Sun,"Special instruments known as spectrographs tell us that the Sun is made almost entirely of two gasses, hydrogen and helium. The temperature at its surface is about 5 500 degrees Celsius – more than 20 times hotter than an oven maximum. In the center, the temperature soars to about 15 million degrees Celsius and the gas is squeezed to about 10 times the density of lead. At such high temperatures and pressures, the Sun becomes a nuclear reactor, where hydrogen is converted to helium. At the same time, huge amounts of radiation are produced. This finds its way to the surface as visible, infrared and ultraviolet light, and X-rays. Every hour, the Sun ejects a billion tons of gas into space at a speed of up to 2 million km per hour. Even so, the Sun is so massive that it can continue burning for billions of years. The Sun becomes more active every 11 years. At such times, the number of dark sunspots on its surface increases. At the peak of the sunspot cycle, there are many more explosive solar storms. During the last solar maximum in 2001, many solar flares and coronal mass ejections blasted billions of tonnes of material into space at high speed. If these storms head towards Earth, they can have serious side-effects. They may cause power cuts, damage satellites, and affect communications and navigation systems. They also cause the Earth's auroras – commonly known as the Northern and Southern Lights.",What is the Sun is made of?,hydrogen and helium

The most famous of these is the Orion nebula, which is just visible with the unaided eye.These clouds start to shrink under their own gravity. As the cloud gets smaller, it breaks into clumps. Each clump eventually becomes so hot and dense that nuclear reactions begin. When the temperature reaches 10 million degrees Celsius, the clump becomes a new star. After their birth, most young stars lie at the center of a flat disc of gas and dust. Most of this material is eventually blown away by the star’s radiation. Before this happens, planets may form around the central star. Infrared observatories are able to detect heat coming from invisible stars that are forming inside such clouds. One of the most powerful of these is ESA's Herschel space observatory, launched in May 2009.

Red stars are the coolest, with surface temperatures of around 2500 degrees Celsius. Blue-white stars are the hottest, reaching a sizzling 40 000 degrees. Yellow stars like the Sun are in-between, with surface temperatures of about 5500 degrees. Stars come in many sizes. The Sun is medium-sized.

Some have a bar of stars across the center, with arms attached at either end. Others have no recognisable shape at all. The largest galaxies look like squashed balls. They contain up to 10 million million stars, but they have very little gas or dust. Nearly all galaxies have a supermassive black hole at the center. Galaxies were born only a few hundred million years after the Universe was created. At that time, about 13 billion years ago, the galaxies were small and much closer together. Collisions were common. As the galaxies smashed into each other they grew in size and changed shape. Since then, the Universe has been expanding. Most galaxies are moving apart at high speed, except in galaxy clusters where they dance around each other.",why the galaxies have different shape and size?,As the galaxies smashed into each other they grew in size and changed shape

What Is Gravity?,"Have you ever wondered why you always fall back to the ground with a bump, no matter how high you jump? People were asking the same question 340 years ago. Then a British scientist named Isaac Newton discovered the force of gravity. The story tells how Isaac was in his garden when an apple fell on his head. While he was rubbing his bruise, he began to wonder why the apple had struck him and not shot upwards instead. Newton came up with the idea that some unseen force must attract the apple towards the Earth. He named this force “gravity” - from the Latin word “gravitas”, meaning “weight”. Newton realized that every object in the Universe attracts every other object in the Universe. Even an apple tugs slightly at everything around it. It is gravity that holds the Moon in orbit around the Earth, and gravity that enables the Sun to hold onto its family of planets. The pull of the Sun and Moon also causes Earth’s ocean tides. However, the strength of gravity depends on the size and density of an object – what scientists call its “mass”. The tiny apple’s gravity is too weak to overcome the attraction of the huge Earth, so it falls towards the center of the planet. Gravity’s pull by an object decreases with distance from it. A climber on top of Mt. Everest weighs a little less than at sea level. If a spaceship travels far enough from Earth, it will eventually escape the planet’s pull completely.",how Isaan Newton discover gravity?,he began to wonder why the apple had struck him and not shot upwards instead.

satellite,"In astronomy, a satellite is an object that orbits (goes around) a planet. There are several hundred natural satellites, or moons, in our Solar System. Thousands of artificial (human-made) satellites have also been launched since 1957. These have many different uses, including taking pictures of the Sun, Earth, and other planets, and looking deep into space at black holes, and distant stars and galaxies. There are also communications satellites, weather satellites, and the International Space Station. The first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched in 1957. It was very simple. A small aluminum ball, about the size of a beach ball, with four long antennas, and was powered by batteries. Inside Sputnik were radio transmitters that sent out a distinctive beep, beep sound which was heard all over the world. The launch of this small and simple satellite marked the beginning of the space age. Modern satellites are much more complicated. Most satellites are designed to be as strong and light as possible. They are built using the same basic model. A platform called a bus contains all the main systems, including the batteries, computer and thrusters. Attached to the bus are antennas, solar arrays and payload instruments (such as cameras, telescopes and communications equipment). Satellites have to power themselves. This is usually done by using large solar arrays (wings) covered with light-sensitive solar cells. The arrays are many meters long and have to be folded during launch. The solar cells provide several kilowatts of power, although they become less efficient as they get older. Most arrays can be turned so that they collect as much sunlight as possible. When the satellite goes into shadow, it gets its power from rechargeable batteries. The side of a satellite facing the Sun gets very hot, while the shaded side becomes very cold. This is a problem because most satellite equipment is sensitive to extreme heat or cold. Ways of protecting the instruments include using layered blankets that look like aluminium foil to keep heat in, and adding radiators to release heat from electrical equipment.",what is a satellite?,an object that orbits (goes around) a planet

Attached to the bus are antennas, solar arrays and payload instruments (such as cameras, telescopes and communications equipment). Satellites have to power themselves. This is usually done by using large solar arrays (wings) covered with light-sensitive solar cells. The arrays are many meters long and have to be folded during launch. The solar cells provide several kilowatts of power, although they become less efficient as they get older. Most arrays can be turned so that they collect as much sunlight as possible. When the satellite goes into shadow, it gets its power from rechargeable batteries. The side of a satellite facing the Sun gets very hot, while the shaded side becomes very cold.

Meteorites ,"Every day about 50 tonnes of rocky material from space lands on the Earth's surface. These rocks are called meteorites. Nearly all meteorites come from the main asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars. Although most asteroids are separated by thousands of kilometres of empty space, collisions are fairly common. Sometimes an entire asteroid can break apart. Mostly a few small pieces are chipped off. These pieces travel through space for millions of years until they are caught by a planet's gravity. If they survive the fiery journey through the air to land on the planet's surface, they become meteorites. Many thousands of meteorites have been found on Earth. From studying these rocks, scientists have learned a lot about the age and birth of the Solar System. Some meteorites have been proved to come from the Moon or Mars. The Hoba iron meteorite of southern Africa is the largest on Earth. It is 10 metres across and weighs 60 tonnes.

Space Exploration,"For centuries, people dreamed about leaving Earth and traveling to other worlds. Then, in 1957, the Soviet Union made the first small step into space by launching a small satellite, called Sputnik. The Space Age had begun. Early space activities were dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union. However, as time went by, Europe and Japan also learned how to build their own satellites and rockets. Today, countries such as China, India, South Korea, Israel and Brazil are developing their own space industries. During the last 60 years, unmanned probes have been sent towards all of the planets in the Solar System, as well as many satellites, asteroids and comets. Spacecraft have soft-landed on half a dozen worlds, while rovers have driven over the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. The Sun has also been explored in great detail by a fleet of spacecraft. Many space observatories, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, have been launched to look at the distant Universe. They have sent back some amazing pictures taken in visible light. But they can also observe stars and galaxies at wavelengths that are invisible to human eyes – radio, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays.

Since everything around us is moving in the same way, we do not usually notice our high speed journey.

The Threat of Melting Ice,"About 20,000 years ago, much of Europe, Asia, North and South America was covered by huge sheets of ice, each many kilometres thick. Since then, the ice has gradually melted and the ice sheets have retreated. Today, the only ice sheets on Earth’s land masses are found in Antarctica and Greenland. Some ice also occurs as glaciers in mountainous regions and as floating ice floes in the Arctic Ocean and around Antarctica. At first glance, these remote left-overs from the last Ice Age seem of little significance for most of us today. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Many scientists believe that our planet is warming as a result of the greenhouse gases that we are pumping into the atmosphere. If the planet becomes warmer, the ice sheets will start to melt, causing sea level to rise perhaps several metres by the end of this century. Such a rise would cause widespread flooding of low-lying coastal areas and threaten many large cities. Observations from space suggest that parts of the major ice sheets are beginning to melt more rapidly. Meanwhile, recent satellite images have also shown that unusually large areas of sea ice have been melting during the Arctic summer. Although sea level will not be affected by melting of the floating ice, there will be other important environmental changes. For example, ice sheets act like a mirror, reflecting sunlight and cooling the Earth. If the ice disappears, Earth is likely to become warmer and major climate changes could occur. Wildlife living in the polar regions may also be devastated.","20,000 years ago, where is covered by ice?","much of Europe, Asia, North and South America was covered by huge sheets of ice"

climate change,"Climate change is when there is a big difference in normal climate patterns over a long amount of time. The Earth’s climate appears to be changing very fast, something that has not happened since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Scientists are not sure exactly how much the climate has changed, or why this is happening, but they do believe that at least some of the changes are because of things we are doing. Scientists believe that the world is getting hotter, which we can see by the melting of the polar ice caps and the rise in sea levels. They think that the increase in ‘greenhouse gases’, gases from factories, cars and aeroplanes that go into the atmosphere, are partly to blame. Global warming is also being made worse by the cutting down of forests and the burning of oil and coal. The ozone layer, which protects us from the sun's harmful UV rays, has become a lot thinner in recent years and in some places has been destroyed completely. This has happened as a result of the amount of aerosols that we use. All these topics are now being studied from space by satellites.

solar system,"The Solar System is made up of the Sun and all of the smaller objects that move around it. Apart from the Sun, the largest members of the Solar System are the eight major planets. Nearest the Sun are four fairly small, rocky planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Beyond Mars is the asteroid belt – a region populated by millions of rocky objects. These are left-overs from the formation of the planets, 4.5 billion years ago. On the far side of the asteroid belt are the four gas giants - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. These planets are much bigger than Earth, but very lightweight for their size. They are mostly made of hydrogen and helium. Until recently, the furthest known planet was an icy world called Pluto. However, Pluto is dwarfed by Earth’s Moon and many astronomers think it is too small to be called a true planet. An object named Eris, which is at least as big as Pluto, was discovered very far from the Sun in 2005. More than 1,000 icy worlds such as Eris have been discovered beyond Pluto in recent years. These are called Kuiper Belt Objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided that Pluto and Eris must be classed as “dwarf planets”. Even further out are the comets of the Oort Cloud. These are so far away that they are invisible in even the largest telescopes. Every so often one of these comets is disturbed and heads towards the Sun. It then becomes visible in the night sky.

However, Pluto is dwarfed by Earth’s Moon and many astronomers think it is too small to be called a true planet. An object named Eris, which is at least as big as Pluto, was discovered very far from the Sun in 2005. More than 1,000 icy worlds such as Eris have been discovered beyond Pluto in recent years. These are called Kuiper Belt Objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided that Pluto and Eris must be classed as “dwarf planets”. Even further out are the comets of the Oort Cloud. These are so far away that they are invisible in even the largest telescopes. Every so often one of these comets is disturbed and heads towards the Sun. It then becomes visible in the night sky.
",what planets in solor system are rocky?,"Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars."
solar system,"The Solar System is made up of the Sun and all of the smaller objects that move around it. Apart from the Sun, the largest members of the Solar System are the eight major planets. Nearest the Sun are four fairly small, rocky planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Beyond Mars is the asteroid belt – a region populated by millions of rocky objects.
