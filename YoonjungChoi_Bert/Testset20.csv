The Universe,"The Universe is everything we can touch, feel, sense, measure or detect. It includes living things, planets, stars, galaxies, dust clouds, light, and even time. Before the birth of the Universe, time, space and matter did not exist. The Universe contains billions of galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars. The space between the stars and galaxies is largely empty. However, even places far from stars and planets contain scattered particles of dust or a few hydrogen atoms per cubic centimeter. Space is also filled with radiation (e.g. light and heat), magnetic fields and high energy particles (e.g. cosmic rays). The Universe is incredibly huge. It would take a modern jet fighter more than a million years to reach the nearest star to the Sun. Travelling at the speed of light (300,000 km per second), it would take 100,000 years to cross our Milky Way galaxy alone. No one knows the exact size of the Universe, because we cannot see the edge – if there is one. All we do know is that the visible Universe is at least 93 billion light years across. (A light year is the distance light travels in one year – about 9 trillion km.) The Universe has not always been the same size. Scientists believe it began in a Big Bang, which took place nearly 14 billion years ago. Since then, the Universe has been expanding outward at very high speed. So the area of space we now see is billions of times bigger than it was when the Universe was very young. The galaxies are also moving further apart as the space between them expands.",Where is the edge of the Universe?,we cannot see the edge

Our nearest star,"The Sun is our nearest star. The Sun provides us with light and heat. It also gives out dangerous ultraviolet light which causes sunburn and may cause cancer. Without the Sun there would be no daylight, and our planet would simply be a dark, frozen world, with no oceans of liquid water and no life. This huge ball of superhot gas is 1.4 million kilometers across, equal to 109 Earths set side by side. With a mass of 2 million-trillion-trillion-trillion kilograms, it weighs as much as 330 000 Earths. About 1 300000 Earths would fit inside the Sun! From Earth, the Sun looks like it moves across the sky in the daytime and appears to disappear at night. This is because the Earth is spinning towards the east. The Earth spins about its axis, an imaginary line that runs through the middle of the Earth between the North and South poles. This means that to us here on the spinning Earth, the Sun appears to rise in the east in the morning, and climb higher and higher in the sky towards midday. In the afternoon the Sun then seems to move lower and lower in the sky before setting in the west. Although it seems small when seen at sunrise or sunset, this is only because the Sun lies about 150 million km away from us. At this distance, it takes about 8 minutes for sunlight to reach us – even when it is traveling at about 300 000 km/s. This means that we see the Sun set eight minutes after the event has actually taken place!",Which direction is the Earth spinning?,Earth is spinning towards the east

The Sun,"Special instruments known as spectrographs tell us that the Sun is made almost entirely of two gasses, hydrogen and helium. The temperature at its surface is about 5 500 degrees Celsius – more than 20 times hotter than an oven maximum. In the center, the temperature soars to about 15 million degrees Celsius and the gas is squeezed to about 10 times the density of lead. At such high temperatures and pressures, the Sun becomes a nuclear reactor, where hydrogen is converted to helium. At the same time, huge amounts of radiation are produced. This finds its way to the surface as visible, infrared and ultraviolet light, and X-rays. Every hour, the Sun ejects a billion tons of gas into space at a speed of up to 2 million km per hour. Even so, the Sun is so massive that it can continue burning for billions of years. The Sun becomes more active every 11 years. At such times, the number of dark sunspots on its surface increases. At the peak of the sunspot cycle, there are many more explosive solar storms. During the last solar maximum in 2001, many solar flares and coronal mass ejections blasted billions of tonnes of material into space at high speed. If these storms head towards Earth, they can have serious side-effects. They may cause power cuts, damage satellites, and affect communications and navigation systems. They also cause the Earth's auroras – commonly known as the Northern and Southern Lights.",how can we study the Sun?,Special instruments known as spectrographs tell us that the Sun

Dwarfs and supergiants,"The Sun is a star. Like most stars, the Sun is a ball of very hot gas that gives off huge amounts of light, heat and other radiation. This radiation is produced by nuclear reactions in the core. It is like millions of hydrogen bombs exploding every second. There are many different types of star. Red stars are the coolest, with surface temperatures of around 2500 degrees Celsius. Blue-white stars are the hottest, reaching a sizzling 40 000 degrees. Yellow stars like the Sun are in-between, with surface temperatures of about 5500 degrees. Stars come in many sizes. The Sun is medium-sized. It burns its hydrogen fuel fairly slowly, so it can keep shining for 10 billion years. Some stars are much bigger and hotter than the Sun. The red supergiant Antares is 800 times wider than the Sun. If it was at the center of our Solar System, it would swallow up all of the inner planets, including Earth. Like gas guzzler cars, these supergiants use all of their hydrogen and helium fuel very quickly. After perhaps 500 million years, they die in a supernova explosion. The coolest, slowest burning stars are red dwarfs. These can survive for more than 10 trillion (10 000 billion) years. Even cooler and smaller are brown dwarfs. These are 'failed stars'. They are so cool – sometimes only a few hundred degrees at the surface - that their nuclear furnaces never start to burn.",Stars can be bigger than the Sun?,Some stars are much bigger and hotter than the Sun

Galaxies,"Nearly all stars belong to gigantic groups known as galaxies. The Sun is one of at least 100 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way. And there are billions of galaxies in the Universe. Everywhere we look in the sky there are galaxies of different shapes and sizes. Some are spirals, with curved arms wrapped around a bright central core. Some have a bar of stars across the center, with arms attached at either end. Others have no recognisable shape at all. The largest galaxies look like squashed balls. They contain up to 10 million million stars, but they have very little gas or dust. Nearly all galaxies have a supermassive black hole at the center. Galaxies were born only a few hundred million years after the Universe was created. At that time, about 13 billion years ago, the galaxies were small and much closer together. Collisions were common. As the galaxies smashed into each other they grew in size and changed shape. Since then, the Universe has been expanding. Most galaxies are moving apart at high speed, except in galaxy clusters where they dance around each other.",what looks like the largest galaxy?,The largest galaxies look like squashed balls

What Is Gravity?,"Have you ever wondered why you always fall back to the ground with a bump, no matter how high you jump? People were asking the same question 340 years ago. Then a British scientist named Isaac Newton discovered the force of gravity. The story tells how Isaac was in his garden when an apple fell on his head. While he was rubbing his bruise, he began to wonder why the apple had struck him and not shot upwards instead. Newton came up with the idea that some unseen force must attract the apple towards the Earth. He named this force “gravity” - from the Latin word “gravitas”, meaning “weight”. Newton realized that every object in the Universe attracts every other object in the Universe. Even an apple tugs slightly at everything around it. It is gravity that holds the Moon in orbit around the Earth, and gravity that enables the Sun to hold onto its family of planets. The pull of the Sun and Moon also causes Earth’s ocean tides. However, the strength of gravity depends on the size and density of an object – what scientists call its “mass”. The tiny apple’s gravity is too weak to overcome the attraction of the huge Earth, so it falls towards the center of the planet. Gravity’s pull by an object decreases with distance from it. A climber on top of Mt. Everest weighs a little less than at sea level. If a spaceship travels far enough from Earth, it will eventually escape the planet’s pull completely.",What objects are having gravity?,every object in the Universe attracts every other object in the Universe

Mars,"Mars is often called the 'Red Planet' because it appears in the sky as an orange-red star. The colour caused the ancient Greeks and Romans to name it after their god of war. Today, thanks to visiting spacecraft, we know that the planet's appearance is due to rust in the Martian rocks. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of 228 million km, half as far again as the Earth, so human visitors would find it very cold. Although summers near the equator can be quite warm, the average temperature is 63 degrees Celsius below zero - similar to winters in Antarctica. The nights are also bitterly cold. The first humans on Mars will have other problems to face. The air is 100 times thinner than on Earth, and mostly made up of carbon dioxide. Human explorers will have to wear oxygen masks and special suits every time they step outside their sealed homes. Violent storms can whip up clouds of dust. Sometimes these spread rapidly around the entire planet, hiding the surface from view.",How we knew that the Mars looks red?,"hanks to visiting spacecraft, we know that the planet's appearance is due to rust in the Martian rocks."

Birth of the Moon,"The Moon has been circling the Earth for more than four billion years. But where did it come from? Some scientists thought that it was captured by the Earth when it came too close. Others thought that it was once part of the Earth. Today, most scientists believe it is the 'Earth's child'. It was born when a wandering planet crashed into the young Earth. Huge amounts of material were thrown into space, eventually coming together to form the Moon. This 'big splash' theory would explain why the Moon’s rocks are very similar to those on the Earth. Unlike the Earth, the Moon seems to be dead inside. Today, there are no volcanic eruptions and any Moonquakes are very small. At its center is a small, solid iron core. There is no magnetic field, so explorers could not use compasses on the Moon.",Why people believe the Moon is the Earth's child?,It was born when a wandering planet crashed into the young Earth
